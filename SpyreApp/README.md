### Description:
This folder contains a simple app which aims to prototype some functionality of the Bus Scheduling Website. It is based on spyre - [`https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre`] (https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre), which is a library for generate simple websites. 

Spyre has only a few basic input and output objects: like buttons, plots, tables, so might be too limiting for a full rescheduling website. A tutorial on spyre can be found ['here'] (https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre/blob/master/tutorial/pydata2015_seattle/pydata2015_seattle.ipynb). This project is aiming to test where Spyre can be sufficient. 

###Installation:

```pip install dataspyre```

###Running the app:
1. move a scheduling file in the /data folder

2. ```python app.py```

3. Go to your browser at localhost:8080

	- input the name of the file
	- input the number of the bus
